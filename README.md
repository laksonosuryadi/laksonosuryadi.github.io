###My First Website Ever!

**About This Site:**

This is my very first website, which I built from scratch.
I tried to apply knowledges of HTML and CSS which I gained from Hacktiv8 Coding Bootcamp online preparation class.
They call this class as Phase-0, which divided into 6 weeks. Each week consists of fundamental knowledges, which will
be useful as a foundation for the upcoming immersive on-site coding class, later on after finishing Phase-0.


**Used Tags & Syntaxes:**  
* `HTML`:  
 * Basic HTML structure : `<html>`,`<head>`, `<title>`,`<body>`
 * Header Tags : `<h1>`,`<h2>`,`<h3>`

* `CSS`:  
 * `font-family`
 * `font-size`


**About Me:**  
:one: I love traveling and photography. I often post my traveling photos on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/laks_lens/).  
:two:  Always love to learn something new. Because while we still breathing, we'll never stop learning.  
:three:  This year will be the turning point of my life. As I escaped from my ~~non~~ comfort zone, and live my life to the fullest! :rocket:


**Future Plans:**  
* To apply all of the knowledges I gained from Hacktiv8 Coding Bootcamp into my Website. :pray:
