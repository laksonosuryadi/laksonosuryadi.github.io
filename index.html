              The main purpose of <b>Phase-0</b> is to equalize the skills of the students. So that when we enter Phase-1, all of us will have the same basic knowledge and capabilty to cope with all the lessons that will be taught. We will be given some modules to read, watch, do, exercise and also some assignments to be submitted each day (from Monday to Friday). In each morning, the instructors will give us the feedback of our submitted assignments, and there are also a score board to see our achievements.
